## Coding Style

To maintain consistency across the codebase, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Code Formatting**:
   - Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent formatting.
   - Install Prettier locally and run it before committing changes.

2. **Linting**:
   - Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with the Airbnb Style Guide.
   - Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors.

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Write clear, self-documenting code.
   - Use functional components and React hooks where applicable.
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
