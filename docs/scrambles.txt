SEO tips;
• ✅ Make sure every page has a unique title + description
• ✅ Internally link between pages (e.g., link your Bandit trick to the Bandit operator page)
• ✅ Use alt text on all images
• ✅ Use clean, readable URLs (e.g., /tips/bandit-trick, not /page?id=14)
• ✅ Compress images + lazy load to boost performance

Tool	Use Case
Ahrefs / Semrush	Keyword research + backlink tracking
Google Search Console	Indexing, performance, click-through rates
Microsoft Clarity	User behavior & UX tuning
Screaming Frog SEO Spider	Technical SEO crawl
PageSpeed Insights / Lighthouse	Performance audit
Ubersuggest (Free)	Budget keyword insights




🧠 Other SEO Best Practices to Consider
✅ Unique & Consistent Metadata Per Page
	• Title tags: max 60 chars
	• Descriptions: max 160 chars
	• Use react-helmet-async to manage this dynamically
	• Make sure each operator/tip/guide has its own title, description, and canonical URL

⚡ Performance: Google Loves Fast Sites
	• Use lazy loading for images and videos
	• Use <img loading="lazy" /> or libraries like react-lazyload
	• Compress images (use tools like TinyPNG or next/image if on Next.js)
	• Use a CDN if possible (e.g., Cloudflare)
Run your site through:
	• Google PageSpeed Insights
	• Lighthouse


Still needs to be worked out;
	- Can we provide merch that isnt copy righted?
	- How can we build an email list for newsletters for later?
	- How to promote the site through for example youtube shorts or instagram
	- Have a downloadable content for example a PDF of a pro league strat to collect emails
	- Research for affiliated links that could be usefull depending on traffic like ' best headsets for siege'  or ' mouses that pros use'
	- Add tier lists for different ranks
	- Pages per operator with all their myths, tricks, strats etc. combined.
	- Add articles like ; 
		○ Best Operators in Y9S2 or 
		○ 'top 10 tricks for X operator'  like top 10 valk cam spots
		○ Operator counter guide
		○ R6 pro settings & gear
	- Add operator comparison lists
	- Add map specific guides
	- Add patch reviews after a new release
	- Add season reviews after a new release
	- How to make content scannable?
	- Let ChatGPT ghostwrite some content
	- Do groundwork on SEO for example what do siege players search for a lot? (maybe do this later with $$) on Ahrefs, Semrush, or even free tools like Ubersuggest.
	- How do I optimise for search terms?
	- Add indexnow for better crawling etc.
	- Performance Optimization
		Website speed is a ranking factor. Consider:
		
		Optimize image sizes with WebP format
		Implement code splitting for faster initial loads
		Use a CDN for static assets
		Enable compression on your server
	
	- Create a Blog Section
	-  Implement Internal Linking Strategy
	
	
	
	

Todo;
	- Add more tricks/tips
	- Componenteize the website a bit more
	Alt text attributes describing the images
	Lazy loading to improve page performance
	Implement Schema Markup for Collections
Add JSON-LD for VideoObject
	Mobile Optimization
	Do performance tests

Test when website is live;
	- Do the ads work?
	- Does the sitemap work and is it correct?

Home page:
- we want to be able to filter roles (do we? or is tags enough)
- we want to add ' credits ' for the person who submitted it
- Add paging to the home page / trick list page
- save the settings (tag, map, operator, side, skill level and theme colors) somewhere (redux???)
- add SEO to pages
- add a search bar to the operators & maps modal
- validate that all the operators and maps are available
- make it so that the tipslist shows different images for example order it by 'unique image' -> 'operator icon & map' -> 'operator' -> 'map' so that it looks unique

Make a discord server --> https://discord.gg/vBt738jk
Do I want to open-source the project or keep a part of it secret?



# ABout open sourcing

Open Source vs. Closed Source for Your R6 Tips Platform
Your project concept is excellent - a community-driven platform for Siege tips with monetization while supporting content creators. Here's my perspective on your open source question:

Open Source Benefits
Community Engagement: Open source projects tend to attract more developer contributions, which can accelerate development and feature additions.

Trust & Transparency: The community may trust an open platform more, especially if they're contributing content.

Bug Fixes & Features: Community developers often fix bugs and add features you might not prioritize or have time for.

Innovation: Contributors might bring ideas you haven't considered.

Open Source Monetization Examples
Many successful platforms are both open source AND profitable:

freeCodeCamp: Open source learning platform that generates revenue through donations
Ghost: Open source blogging platform with a paid hosting service
VS Code: Open source editor with Microsoft backing
Mastodon: Open source social network that allows for donations
Hybrid Approaches to Consider
Open Core Model: Make the basic platform open source, but offer premium features or hosted versions.

Transparent Monetization: Open source the code but be clear about monetization (showing community that ads/affiliate links support the platform).

Revenue Sharing: Your idea to share revenue with content creators is excellent and aligns with open source values.

Implementation Suggestions
If you decide to go open source:

Clear License: Choose a license that allows monetization (MIT or Apache 2.0).

Contribution Guidelines: Document how people can contribute code and content.

Revenue Transparency: Be open about how money is made and distributed.

Attribution System: Ensure content creators get proper credit and metrics.

Final Thoughts
Open sourcing doesn't prevent monetization - many successful platforms do both effectively. The key is transparency with your community about monetization methods and ensuring value flows back to contributors.

Your Discord server could serve as the hub for both content contributors and code contributors, creating a vibrant ecosystem around the project.

🎯 Brand Style Direction (Visual Identity)
Let’s define the vibe before jumping into logo sketches:
Brand Name:
TheStratbook
Keywords to Visualize:
	• Tactical
	• Competitive
	• Minimal
	• Gamer-focused
	• Modern
	• Scalable across games
Tone:
Confident, clean, and gamer-savvy. Think something that wouldn’t look out of place next to logos like Aim Lab, Blitz.gg, or Tracker.gg — but unique.

🧠 Concept Exploration
Here are a few directions we could take:
Option 1: Tactical + Iconic
	• A book icon stylized like a tactical map or stratboard (clean lines, minimal detail)
	• Open book with grid lines or hexes to imply planning
	• Could include a small crosshair or angle symbol tucked in
Option 2: Gamer Font + Modern Glyph
	• Strong, futuristic or military-style font
	• A small glyph: stylized “S” or “SB” mark
	• Clean, flat design for easy favicon use
Option 3: Angle Icon (more abstract)
	• Incorporate a 90° angle or peek-angle symbol (very "siege" or tactical shooter-specific)
	• Make it part of the S or logo mark
	• Something you could also animate later for brand content

🎨 Color & Style Suggestions

Element	Suggested Style
Font	Sleek, geometric sans-serif or tactical serif (e.g., Orbitron, Rajdhani, Quantico)
Color	Dark slate, white, accent in neon cyan, electric yellow or blood red
Logo Type	Combination mark (text + icon) or monogram

✅ Deliverables You’ll Want
	• Horizontal logo (site header)
	• Square logo (favicon)
	• Icon-only version (for Discord, socials)
	• SVG, PNG, and dark/light versions

Explore strategies, operator tips, gadget tricks, and unique map angles to elevate your Rainbow Six: Siege gameplay. Built by Siege fans for the Siege community, our platform is fast, accessible, and packed with intuitive filters to help you find the perfect strategy.

  → Often broken down by map, site, side (attack/defense), and scenario.
2. 🧠 Strats / Stratbook / Strat Sheet
  → “Strats” is the go-to shorthand.
  → A Stratbook is usually a doc or tool that holds all planned tactics.
3. 📊 Setups
  → Especially in R6/Siege, “setups” refer to how a defense is built (rotate holes, reinforcements, gadgets, etc.)
4. 🎯 Executes (or "Execs")
  → Common in tactical shooters like R6 or Valorant. These are specific attacking strats — e.g., "Hookah exec" or "Basement plant exec."

R6 mythbusters (MB)

Rainbow 6 mythbusters idea is back! A website inspired by the OG series of coreross called mythbusters

A searchable website with all kinds of myth based on operators, gadgets and everything else.
With credit references to coreross if he covered it or if someone else covered it mention them.
Potentially referencing a link to how to use it in a trick from the other website.


R6 Tips & Tricks


Rainbow 6 tips and tricks

A playbook full of working strats, tricks and tips for people from every level, divided into ranks of usefulness (Strat based or simple/fun) and easily filtered by map, site, operator, solo or with x amount of people etc.

From simple thermite tricks to open a electrified hatch or wall to insane Azami spots or grenade throw places.
With reference to a 5 man stack Strat or different tips and call-outs from known people in the scene.

Main focus will be a website where you can go to on your phone and easily find cool tricks that you as attacker or defender or even awesome drone spots.
With both a textual description of the trick and a video for references.
Tekst should be in markdown format so we can easily edit it
A file per trick with metadata would be nice and handy


For some Strats you need multiple operators so that will need to be specified appropriately

What are nice visible visuals for people?
Maybe in later stages an interactive map?



R6 HUB / External tools

A website for everyone who plays R6 and wants to find out more information about a certain subject.

	- R6 Pro League (+other tiers)
	- R6 competitive (ranked, siege cup & competitive content like strats videos and blogs etc)
	- R6 fun (quick match, standard, fun siege games like strat roulette or the operator kill board from baldrikk)
	- R6 community (or other name, with random things like r6 market place, fun YouTuber and streamers, discord servers etc)
