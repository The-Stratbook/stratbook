  "FAQ": [
    {
      "question": "How long does this strategy take to set up?",
      "answer": "The setup takes approximately 90 seconds, which includes the initial droning and vertical destruction phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this work against higher-rank players?",
      "answer": "Yes, this strategy has been successfully used in Platinum and Diamond ranks because it relies on **coordinated teamwork** rather than opponent mistakes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if the defenders reinforce the ceiling?",
      "answer": "The strategy includes alternative entry points through VIP and Aquarium if ceiling reinforcements are in place. Buck can still open up unreinforced portions for line-of-sight."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this viable in solo queue?",
      "answer": "While coordination makes this strategy more effective, the vertical pressure aspect can be executed solo. Communication with your team about your intentions is still recommended."
