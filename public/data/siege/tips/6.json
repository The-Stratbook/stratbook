    "description":  "**[Maverick](/siege/hub/operators/maverick) tricking** is an essential technique for opening reinforced walls when [Thatcher](/siege/hub/operators/thatcher) is banned. This technique involves making horizontal lines at the top and bottom of a reinforced wall, which causes it to lose its reinforcement properties and can be breached with a regular soft breach afterwards.",
