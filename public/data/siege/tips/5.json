  "description": "When playing **Nomad**, place Airjabs in unexpected positions that still cover high-traffic areas. Instead of placing them directly on site, set them behind half-walls or in adjacent rooms that defenders can rotate to. This prevents attackers from benefiting from your Airjabs while still keeping your team in range.",
