    "description":  "When playing with **[Fuze](/siege/hub/operators/fuze)**, **[Thermite](/siege/hub/operators/thermite)** and an **EMP Operator**, use your cluster charges to counter [Bandit](/siege/hub/operators/bandit) tricking. Place the cluster charge on the reinforced wall that [Bandit](/siege/hub/operators/bandit) is trying to electrify right after someone used an EMP to disable his active charge. Detonate the charge to destroy the [Bandit](/siege/hub/operators/bandit) batteries and potentially kill bandit and allow your hard breacher to open the wall next to the one you just fuzed.",
